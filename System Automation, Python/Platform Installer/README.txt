This program is in the initial working stages. 
Written by Kelcey Damage, 2012

The goal is to create and manage complex system/platform configurations, and then deploy to fresh virtual machines. I plan on using Paramiko for the remote connectivity, and possibly Fabrik.

Current working features are below:

+Package installation
+Service managing
+Repo installation

Plans to add a command queue and advanced configuration tool for installed packages.

Thanks
