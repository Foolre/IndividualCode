Basically whenever the you try to load a console it will look for a file on the host called:

/usr/local/cs_python_modules/natchecker.py

The minimum that file needs to contain is 'print "{-any-public-ip-}"'

If that file exists, CS will use that IP for connecting to the CPVM. If it does not exist, CS will act as normal.

You can get creative in that file and add logic, APIs, firewall interaction.....

Thanks
